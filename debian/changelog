    Remove Boost Software License from license tag
  * Remove Boost Software License from license tag
    The Boost Software License was only in there for Poco, as can be seen in
    6e0659f. As Poco was removed in 44ab6fb and all remaining Files have a
    BSD header, let's remove the Boost tag as well, to be consistent.

    Fix wrong package name test
  * Throw an exception if ClassLoader can't be instantiated due to an invalid package name
  * Merge pull request #33 <https://github.com/ros/pluginlib/issues/33> from clearpathrobotics/getName-split-fix
    Add ":" to split function within getName.
  * Add ":" to split function within getName.
    getName split wasn't supporting :: as the delimiter for the package name and
    the plugin name.
