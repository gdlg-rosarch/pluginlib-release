%description
The pluginlib package provides tools for writing and dynamically loading plugins
using the ROS build infrastructure. To work, these tools require plugin
providers to register their plugins in the package.xml of their package.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
